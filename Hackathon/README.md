# Hackathon by Dialog Insight - 2019

## General presentation
The goal of this project was to develop a maze web app in a single day.\
We had a total of 9 hours to do everything.

Since the goal of Dialog Insight was to make us learn Vue.js, they prepared code for what they judged wasn't pertinent for the project. We had access to a template Vue app that prints a base web page and an API that handled authentification and give us 2 mazes, one easy and one advanced.

## Prize won
There was 3 prizes
- Most overall functionalities
- Best UI
- Cleanest code

Our team won the *most functionalities* and finished in close second place for *cleanest code*.
